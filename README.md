# [CoMaps](https://comaps.app) – Hike, Bike, Drive Offline – Easy Map Navigation with Privacy

A community-led free & open source maps app based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data and reinforced with commitment to transparency, privacy and being not-for-profit. CoMaps is a fork/spin-off of Organic Maps, which in turn is a fork of Maps.ME.

There are apps for Android and iOS (and ARM macOS).
An alpha linux / macOS Qt desktop version, which is also suitable for linux phones.

**We're working on getting first app releases out soon, please stay tuned!**

**Offline-focused**: Plan and navigate your trip abroad without the need for cellular service, search waypoints while on a distant hike, etc. All app functions are designed to work offline.

**Simple and Polished**: essential easy to use features that just work.

**Saves Your Battery and Space**: Doesn’t drain your battery like other navigation apps. Compact maps save precious space on your phone.

**Free and Built by the Community**: People like you helped build the app by adding places to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), testing and giving feedback on features and contributing their development skills and money.
