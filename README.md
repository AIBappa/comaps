CoMaps is a new community-driven project born out of the desire to create a truly open, transparent, and community-focused navigation app. Our mission is to provide easy, offline navigation for drivers, hikers, and cyclists, with a strong emphasis on open-source principles and respecting data privacy. We are committed to building a world where the top choice for navigation software is free and developed through open collaboration.

### Community Action

The CoMaps project emerged in response to the growing concerns and dissatisfaction within the Organic Maps community. The original Organic Maps project, while initially promoted as an open community effort, faced significant issues related to governance, transparency, and the potential for shareholder profit at the expense of the community. These concerns were detailed in an open letter to Organic Maps shareholders, which can be found [here](https://openletter.earth/open-letter-to-organic-maps-shareholders-a0bf770c). Despite some positive steps, the lack of a substantive resolution has led to the decision to start a new independent project.


### New Path Forward

At CoMaps, we are dedicated to ensuring that all project-related efforts are conducted in public, providing full transparency in decision-making, priorities, goals, financials, and operations. We believe in community decision-making, where those impacted by decisions have a voice and are empowered to participate. Our project operates as a not-for-profit entity, focusing on creating value for the community rather than generating profit. We are committed to maintaining the complete codebase and associated resources under Free and Open Source Software licenses, ensuring that development is open and transparent.
Privacy is an important part of the project. The app does not track users or collect data behind the scenes; if there is potential of data collection, for example sharing app logs with tech support, it is fully disclosed and requires opt-in consent. Funding for CoMaps primarily comes from community donations, and possibility of grants and B2B products, as long as they align with the principles and are approved by the community. All assets created or acquired are owned by the community and used for its benefit. We are building a navigation app that is not only easy to use and fast, but also reflects the values of openness, transparency, and community collaboration. Join us in creating a navigation solution that truly serves the public good.

**Offline-focused**: Plan and navigate your trip abroad without the need for cellular service, search waypoints while on a distant hike, etc. All app functions are designed to work offline.

**No Data Collection**: The app is designed with privacy in mind - does not identify people, does not track, and does not collect any information.

**Save Your Battery**: Efficiently uses the battery during your travels, doesn’t drain your battery like other navigation apps.

**Free and Built by the Community**: People like you helped build the app by adding locations to OpenStreetMap, giving feedback on features, and contributing code on Codeberg in the open-source community.

## What's the difference to Organic Maps?

CoMaps is a fork/spin-off of Organic Maps, which in turn is a fork/spin-off of Maps.me. The CoMaps project emerged in response to the growing concerns and dissatisfaction with the Organic Maps leadership. The original Organic Maps project, while initially promoted as an open community effort, faced significant issues related to governance, transparency, and the potential of shareholder profit at the expense of the community. These concerns were detailed in an open letter to Organic Maps shareholders, which can be found [here](https://openletter.earth/open-letter-to-organic-maps-shareholders-a0bf770c). Despite some positive steps, the lack of a substantial resolution has led former Organic Maps contributors to the decision to start a new independent project.

With CoMaps, we want to overcome these issues by moving to a nonprofit structure (not finished yet), greater inclusivity in decision-making, and financial transparency.
